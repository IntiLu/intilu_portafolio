                    The following data comes from: <a href = "https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Government/Fleet-Equipment-Inventory/93vc-wpdr/about_data">

                    Data looks like:

                <p>
                    Firts of all, we format the cvs archive as data table in excel
                    this allow us to filter and set pivot tables in a proper way
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let's clean our data by removing empty and duplicated rows. 
                    For removing empty rows we can filter any column by empty celds 
                    and delate that rows.

                <P>
                    Once we removed empty rows we need to remove duplicated rows. We can
                    do it with the buttom remove duplicates
                </P>

                <p>
                    We check for spelling mistakes and extra blanck spaces in the data and fix them, 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We use Flash Fill to reduce the department names (columns A and B) to just one column

                <p>
                    The quantity of equipment can be obtained by summing column C, 
                    resulting in 549 vehicles. The data shows a highly uneven distribution 
                    of equipment, with minimum values indicating specialized or low-demand usage, 
                    while maximum values highlight operationally critical departments. 
                    The average serves only as a general reference due to high variability.
                    We could make an extensive analisys with a pivot table
                </p>

                <p>
                    The distribution of equipment is highly concentrated in operational departments 
                    such as General Services and Fire and Rescue, while administrative departments 
                    show minimal allocation. This reflects functional priorities rather than an even 
                    distribution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    General Services’ fleet is primarily composed of utility and off-road vehicles, 
                    reflecting its role as an operational support department across multiple functions.
